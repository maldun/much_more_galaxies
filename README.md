# Much More Galaxies

Provides more Galaxies for Stellaris. Supports Galaxy sizes from 25-2500 and adds much more shapes.

The following shapes are added:

* Barred Spiral ([SBa and SBc types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barred_spiral_galaxy))
* Clusters (2,4\* & 6)
* Cross
* Dragon Tail\* 
* Fan (3 & 4)
* Gear
* Irregular (Type 1,2\* & 3)
* Snowflake (4 & 6)
* Square

This mod draws inspiration (and some settings) from:

Definitely check them out especially if you want bigger Galaxy sizes! I don't support more than 2.5k because a 10k Galaxy only is good for the memes as most PCs will have trouble with them in
more recent versions of Stellaris.
